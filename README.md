## How to use the Plugin
Place the CSReduction prefab under the Main Camera and tick the checkbox for each Cyber Sickness (CS) reduction technique you want to be executed.

## Techniques implemented so far
- Rotation Blur
 
    Right now this effect requires some tinkering in order for it to work. The developer first needs to import the PostProcessing package, then add a Post-process Layer component to the Main Camera in the scene.

- Virtual Nose

    Places a simple sphere shaped nose under the player's field of view to give them a static rest frame.
